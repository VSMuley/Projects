**A Gate Compensated Gain Enhanced Transconductance Amplifier**

The proposed work is about a gain-enhanced transconductance amplifier with improved phase
margin and higher bandwidth. An amplifier is designed and evaluated for three main
performance metrics namely gain or transconductance, phase margin and bandwidth. Miller
compensation is performed on conventional OTA to improve phase margin while Gate
compensation to improve its bandwidth as well. The proposed OTA is designed and implemented
to improve gain of the amplifier as compared to conventional OTA. Differential amplifier pairs
are replaced with telescopic amplifier pairs to achieve high gain. It is observed that
implementation of telescopic topology approximately squares the gain of the conventional OTA.
Bandwidth and phase margin remains the same as in conventional OTA. The simulation is done
using the Spectre environment in the Cadence Virtuoso platform and under UMC 180nm
Technology.
